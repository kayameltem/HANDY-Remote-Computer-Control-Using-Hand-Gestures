# HANDY-Remote-Computer-Control-Using-Hand-Gestures
Handy is an interface that aims to provide remote computer control with the user's hand movements. Certain commands will be assigned to hand gestures in the application, and when the user makes these gestures while the application is running, it will execute the assigned command. In this project, Mediapipe is used for identifying hand gestures.

**Since a local database is used in this project, it is not possible to use the project without setting the database. However, this project may be a good starting point to develop your own hand gesture project using MediaPipe.**
